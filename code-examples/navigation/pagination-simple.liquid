  title: Simple pagination
  description: Pagination is an ordered numbering of pages usually located at the top or bottom of a webpage. It enables users to navigate through a series of pages where content has been split up for design purposes, usability, faster loading, an so on. Note: this simplified example does not output a fully accessible pagination. For an accessible pagination, see the next Pagination example.

  step_1: Place the following code where you wish pagination to display. This code must appear within `paginate` tags for the following example to work. Within the `paginate` tags, you can access the [paginate](https://help.shopify.com/en/themes/liquid/objects/paginate) object.
  step_2: Specify the type of content you want to paginate, and at what limit you wish to paginate by, for example `{% paginate collection.products by 12 %}`.
  step_3: Override the`| default_pagination` filter `Next »` and `« Previous` labels by passing a new label to the `next` and `previous` options.
