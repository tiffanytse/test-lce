# Liquid Library
### Build and customize themes faster with Shopify's Liquid Library.

This library provides practical code examples that illustrate best practices to build reliable and accessible themes. Use the library to learn Liquid, onboard new team members, and jump start your development on Shopify!
**Please note:** We have intentionally limited CSS and JavaScript, and removed translation strings in order to keep these examples compatible with any theme. Any CSS we have included is for accessibility or rendering purposes.

## Getting Started

To get Liquid Library up and running, type the following:

```sh
yarn install
yarn s
```

and it should be up and running on port 8000
